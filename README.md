Hello,

This is my first real project I'm am making in order to better understand the world of front-end web development.
It involves API calls and javascript animations as well as some basic use of CSS and obviously HTML.

I can't think of much else to say about it as of right now, perhaps I'll have more to say when I am happy with it.
